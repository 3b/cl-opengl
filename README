cl-opengl is a set of bindings and utilities for accessing the OpenGL,
GLU and GLUT APIs using CFFI.

The examples/ directory contains a couple of examples using cl-glut,
cl-opengl and cl-glu. Note, however, that you can use each of these
independently. In particular, you can use a windowing toolkit other
than (Free)GLUT, if you wish.
